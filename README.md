# Hi, my name is **Elvira Gizatullina**
I'm originally from Russia, but have been lived in the USA for 10 years. I love travel and visit different countries to earn their culture. I just come back from my vocation where I visited 5 countries: Russia, Belguim, France, UK, Netherlands. I want to open my own freelance web design company and work remotly from different anywhere I want. 
## Interesting facts about me:
* I love dogs
* Crazy about snowboarding
* Love sushi
* Have done Skydiving twice
* Have an accent
* I don't look like Russian and a lot of people think that I'm Brazilian. Lol

I really like work on cumputers and create new websites. Last year I took IMCP class certification and FEWD1. I really enjoy to create something new and work on photoshop. One of my favorite picture is me with city in background that I created in Photoshop.
